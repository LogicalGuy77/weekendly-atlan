## How It Works

The app calculates a "vibe score" for your weekend based on the balance of high, medium, and low energy activities, the variety of moods you've planned for, and how well your activities match the weather. It's a fun way to see if you've created a well-rounded weekend.

You can filter activities by category, mood, energy level, duration, weather dependency, and tags. The search function looks through activity titles, descriptions, and tags to help you find exactly what you're looking for.
